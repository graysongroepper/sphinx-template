**Thesis:** Tutorial on building your own USB Rubber Ducky using a Digispark and
    Arduino.

* Step 1 - Disclaimer

    * Before starting, inform the person that the way they use this can be
    illegal, if used in any criminal activity or without someones permission.

* Step 2 - Download and setup Arduino for the Digispark.

    * Provide link for download webpage.
    * Provide step by step on how to set it up (with screenshots) [#f4]_

* Step 3 - Purchase a couple Digisparks.

    * Buy the Digispark attiny85. (photo of Digispark)
    * Need a few extra just in case one does not work.
    * Amazon sells these

* Step 4 - Create the scripts you want to use.

    * Create a simple script first (provide script) [#f4]_
        * The script will bring up notepad and repeat Hello World
        * Step by step creation of script (have each line of the script)
        * Show completed script
        * Explain script (Delay, Key, GUI, etc.) [#f6]_

* Step 5 - Download the script we made onto the Digispark.

    * Press the arrow in the top left
    * Have 10 seconds to insert the Digispark
    * Once inserted it will begin to download onto the Digispark
    * Once downloaded it is ready to be inserted into a computer

* Step 6 - Do a downloaded script.

    * Do a Download one
        * Use CedArctic's Scripts from github [#f5]_
        * Use a safe one like Rick_Roll
        * Explain what this script will be doing

* Step 7 - Download the script onto the Digispark.

    * Press the arrow in the top left
    * Have 10 seconds to insert the Digispark
    * Once inserted it will begin to download onto the Digispark
    * Once downloaded take it out of the computer
    * The Digispark is ready to be inserted to a computer
