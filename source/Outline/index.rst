**Thesis:** Tutorial on building your own USB Rubber Ducky using a Digispark and
    Arduino.

* Step 1 - Download and setup Arduino for the Digispark.

    * Provide step by step on how to set it up (with screenshots) [#f4]_

* Step 2 - Purchase a couple Digisparks.

    * Buy the Digispark attiny85. (photo of Digispark)
    * Need a few extra just in case one does not work.
    * Amazon sells these

        * Step by step creation of script (have each line of the script)
        * Show completed script
        * Explain script (Delay, Key, GUI, etc.)

* Step 4 - Download the script we made onto the Digispark.

    * Press the arrow in the top left
    * Have 10 seconds to insert the Digispark
    * Once inserted it will begin to download onto the Digispark
    * Once downloaded it is ready to be inserted into a computer

* Step 5 - Do a downloaded script.

    * Do a Download one
        * Use CedArctic's Scripts from github [#f5]_
        * Use a safe one like Rick_Roll
        * Explain what this script will be doing

* Step 6 - Download the script onto the Digispark.

    * Press the arrow in the top left
    * Have 10 seconds to insert the Digispark
    * Once inserted it will begin to download onto the Digispark
    * Once downloaded it is ready to be inserted into a computer
