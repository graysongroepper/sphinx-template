**Thesis:** Tutorial on building your own USB Rubber Ducky using a Digipark and
    Arduino.

* Step 1 - Download and setup Arduino for the Digispark.

    * Provide step by step on how to set it up with photos [#f4]_

* Step 2 - Purchase a couple Digisparks.

    * Buy the Digispark attiny85. (photo of Digispark)
    * Need a few extra just in case one does not work.
    * Amazon sells these

* Step 3 - Create or download the scripts you want to use.

        * The script will bring up notepad and repeat Hello World
        * Explain script (Delay, Key, GUI, etc.)

    * Do a Download one (safe one like Rick_Roll)
        * Use CedArctic's Scripts from github [#f5]_

    * Press the arrow in the top left
    * Have 10 seconds to insert the Digispark
    * Once inserted it will begin to download
